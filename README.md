**Teak Shippping** is a Drupal Commerce module to calculate shipping rates for [teakmoebel.com](http://teakmoebel.com/).

It's not directly usable for your website but it can be a great starting point 
for complex shipping price calculations based on geographic elements (in this case
distance, countries and provinces) and product category (e.g. tables, chairs, cabinets)
with minimum and maximum pricing.


The module was published on github with the permission of the client.


## Future

Actual numbers might still change,
and will probably be moved to configuration files or similar.

The main teak_shipping.module will probably be split up,
and we might create classes for different countries and cases.

`dpm()` going to be removed.
